# Multivariate Multicycle Codes For Complete Single Shot Decoding

This repository serves as a database for X- and Z-tyle parity check matrices and metacheck matrices of quantum error correcting code, namely Multivariate Multicycle code in Matrix Market format that is easy to use when using code distance algorithms as well calculating confinement profiles using [dist-m4ri program](https://github.com/QEC-pages/dist-m4ri).

All of the code instances were expliclty generated via [QuantumClifford.jl](https://github.com/QuantumSavory/QuantumClifford.jl) and for more details about various families of codes that are subfamilies of MM codes, please visit [MM code documentation](https://qc.quantumsavory.org/dev/ECC_API/#QuantumCliffordOscarExt.MultivariateMulticycle).
